        "For this lab assignment, we will be working with the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) hosted on the UCI machine learning repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the banking industry, an important task is to market their products (e.g., a term deposit or a credit card) to potential customers. However, such tasks are usually challenging as banks need to **cautiously balance the cost of large-scale marketing campaigns and the profit of signing up more customers.**\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this issue, machine learning models have been widely adopted by the banking industry to identify potential customers and improve marketing effectiveness. In this lab assignment, you are tasked to develop machine learning models to **predict whether a customer would sign up a term deposit using various features collected by a bank.** You also need to evaluate the performance of each model and recommend the most preferred model to the stakeholders in the marketing department.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the section below, we provide the code to download two csv files, namely `bank-train.csv` and `bank-test.csv`, for the Bank Marketing dataset. The `bank-train.csv` includes information on **32,158 customers** and the `bank-test.csv` includes information on another **8,040 customers**. For both datasets, there are 11 features that you can use for prediction. Below we list the detailed definitions for each feature:\n",
        "* age: age of the customer\n",
        "* housing: whether the customer has housing loan (0 for no; 1 for yes)\n",
        "* loan: whether the customer has personal loan (0 for no; 1 for yes)\n",
        "* contact: contact communication type (0 for cellular; 1 for telephone)\n",
        "* campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this customer\n",
        "* previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this customer\n",
        "* emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator\n",
        "* cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicato\n",
        "* cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator\n",
        "* euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator\n",
        "* nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator\n",
        "\n",
        "The label you are going to predict has the name `y`, which indicates whether the customer signed up for the term deposit or not (0 for no; 1 for yes).\n"
